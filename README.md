<p align="right">
  " Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month.<br> The main objective is to predict the stock’s closing price of the month.

 History and Background:
</summary>
<br>
<p align="center">
  YES BANK was founded in 1999 by Ashok Kapur, Harkirat Singh, and Rana Kapoor, with Rabobank holding a significant 75% share. The bank underwent a rebranding in 2003, which saw the resignation of Harkirat Singh due to Rabobank's considerable influence over hiring decisions. The early 2000s were challenging for YES BANK as it faced difficulties in raising capital and accumulated substantial losses, resulting in downgrades and the withdrawal of deposits. A significant leadership change occurred when Rana Kapoor was fired and later arrested for money laundering. Under the new leadership of Kumar, the bank repositioned itself and received support through the YES Bank Reconstruction Scheme 2020. By July 2020, YES BANK's follow-on public offer (FPO) saw a 95% subscription, and the State Bank of India (SBI) acquired a 30% stake in the bank.

 Financial Crisis and Reconstruction:
</summary>
<br>
<p align="center">
  In March 2020, YES BANK faced a severe crisis when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a 30-day moratorium due to the bank's excessive bad loans. This resulted in restrictions on withdrawals, limiting them to ₹50,000. The crisis was swiftly addressed as SBI and a consortium of banks infused capital into YES BANK, leading to a rapid recovery and the lifting of the moratorium within 12 days. Despite the recovery, the bank's ratings were downgraded by ICRA and Moody's, and founder Rana Kapoor faced legal issues, including an arrest for money laundering. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) proposed a fine for fraudulent bond sales, highlighting the regulatory challenges the bank faced during this period.

   What is Supervised learning?
  </summary>
  <br>
  <p align="left">
    Supervised models in machine learning are a type of model that learn to make predictions or decisions from a set of labeled data. The term "supervised" refers to the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset, which is like a teacher supervising the learning process. Here's a more detailed explanation:<br><br>
1. Labeled Data: In supervised learning, the data used for training is labeled. This means each example in the training set consists of input data (often referred to as features) and the corresponding output (often referred to as the label or target). For example, in a dataset for house price prediction, the features might include the size of the house, the number of rooms, and the location, while the label would be the price of the house.<br><br>
2. Learning from Examples: The supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. This process is called learning because the algorithm improves its performance on the task as it processes more data.<br><br>
3. Types of Tasks:<br><br>
  * Classification: In classification tasks, the outputs are discrete categories. For example, identifying whether an email      is spam or not spam is a classification task.<br>
   * Regression: In regression tasks, the outputs are continuous values. For example, predicting the price of a house based       on various features is a regression task.<br><br>
4. Generalization: The ultimate goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data. This means that after training, the model should be able to make accurate predictions or decisions for examples it has never seen before.<br><br>
5. Applications: Supervised learning models are used in a wide range of applications including image and speech recognition, credit scoring, predicting customer behavior, and many more.<br>

In summary, supervised models are a foundational element of machine learning, where the focus is on learning a mapping from inputs to outputs, using examples where the correct outputs are known.<br>

   What is it called Regression?
  </summary>
  <br>
  <p align="left">
    A regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent (explanatory) variables. A regression model is able to show whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the explanatory variables.
